# swaggest-test
Here at [Motel](http://motel.is) we are starting to use Swagger more to properly build out and document our APIs. Once we found [swagger-test](https://github.com/earldouglas/swagger-test), we fell in love. However, our intense lust soon died out to the reality of a very small library with no updates and very little support. We tried to make our own [improvements](https://github.com/MotelIs/swagger-test), but the API/parsing of swagger-test didn't cut it. For this reason, we decided that if it was going to be done right, we had to do it ourselves.
